# TL2cgen

**TL2cgen** is a model compiler for decision tree models.
You can convert any decision tree models (random forests, gradient boosting models) into C code and distribute it as a native binary.

TL2cgen seamlessly integrates with [Treelite](https://github.com/dmlc/treelite).
Any tree models that are supported by Treelite can be translated using TL2cgen.
